# ðŸ¦™ Alpaca Excerpt Bot

Extract news under topics of interest (MEV, security, development) from [DefiLlama Round Up](https://defillama.com/roundup)
and forward to my own Telegram [channel](https://t.me/iq30_tg).

## Architecture

The script itself is quite simple. Actually, more work is done on figuring out and setting up the
environment where it runs. I chose to deploy the bot on Google Cloud Functions (a serverless
platform). The following chart describe the overall architecture.

    C -- subscribe --> B
```

## Requirements

-   A [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) account.
-   Set up a [Scheduler](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/create-secret) for the daily
    cron job.
-   Set up a [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publish-receive-messages-console) topic.
-   Obtain a [Telegram bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and store it in [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/create-secret).
-   Install [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) command line tool.
